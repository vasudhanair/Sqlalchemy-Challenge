# Sqlalchemy-Challenge
This has a folder called the .ipynb_checkpoints, a README.md file, a Python file( appy.py) and a jupyter notebook named climate_starter.ipynb.
Dependencies are Pandas module in Python, SQLalchemy module in Python and Flask

A trip to Hawaii is undertaken and some analysis is carried out based off of some climate data found in a SQLite database. The following analyses were done:

Using SQLAlchemy to reflect existing databases to classes in Python
Using queries to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotting them over time using a pandas DataFrame
Designing queries to obtain the total number of stations, the most active stations, and the last 12 months of temperature observation data (summarized as a histogram)
Creating a Flask API app to create routes that retrieve JSON data such as precipitation values by date, stations, temperature observations from the last year, and min, max, and average temperatures within a specified date range.
